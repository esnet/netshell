/**
 * An AuthorizationResource is an abstract class that implements authorization for a given container to use
 * resources that are shared or controlled by another container. Typically, an NetShell application that brokers
 * resources for other application, such as network provisioning for instance, extends AuthorizationResource
 * to describe what a container has the right to do, by overwriting  the isAuthorized(Resource) method.
 *
 * AuthorizationResource can also be used to implement delegation: like any Resource, an AuthorizationResource
 * can have parents and children, forming an authorization graph. The authorization graph is secured by
 * forbidding un-privileged thread to change the parents or children. In other words, management of the
 * authorization must be made within a SysCall implemented by the resource broker (NetShell application).
