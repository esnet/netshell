/**
 * SSHD IoServiceFactory. Mina's default two IoServiceFactory (mina and nio2) cannot be used due
 * a problem with the thread creation within the ThreadPool they use: the thread pool is configured
 * with no pre-started threads. Threads are then dynamically created when need. This cannot work
 * with NetShell security model since threads are set with a specific user ThreadGroup: once an Thread is
 * created for a user, it will not be able to be changed to another user and therefore creating SecurityExceptions
 * when another user is trying to log into NetShell and re-using threads from the pool.
 *
 * The current implementation creates a ThreadPool with a fixed size and immediately pre start
 * all of them while being privileged. This is not a perfect solution. Using a custom ThreadFactory
 * running with a background thread to create the thread would be better
